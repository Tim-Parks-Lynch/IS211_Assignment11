Hi Professor,

Sorry this is late. I was experimenting with python's virtual environments, so I pinned the dependencies in the requirements.txt file. Please let me know if any issues with them. I did some client-side validation in the html and server-side validation in flask, so you might need to take off the required field in the label for task, or use postman. I didn't handle the validation for priority, because I wasn't thinking of postman at the time.

Please let me know if any issues.

# NOTE TO MYSELF:

Virtual Environment Setup:
python-m venv venv

Activate Environment Setup:
source venv/bin/activate

Deactivate Environment Setup:

Pin requirements:
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt

Install requirements:
